# Badges

You can dynamically add badges based on any condition for an attribute returned in a hit.

There are two examples already defined in `/config/badgesConfig`, please follow the same example by adjusting that file.

When two triggers are matched, the one found first in the configuration array will be the one which is shown, more than one badge is not currently supported.
