# Demo Tour

This app offers the ability to present a guided tour to the user, highlighting different elements and explaining them. The feature is currently in BETA, and is subject to change. It is on by default; it can be turned off by going to `config/demoTourConfig` and setting the `default` value of `shouldShowDemoTour` to `false`.

You can configure your tour by adjusting the `steps` const, also found in `config/demoTourConfig`.
