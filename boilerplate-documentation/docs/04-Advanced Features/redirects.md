# Redirects

Redirects are already activated in the application. In order to trigger one, simply create a rule in the dashboard where the consequence is:

```
{
 "isRedirected": true,
 "redirect": "URL TO REDIRECT TO GOES HERE"
}
```

You can find an example redirect rule by searching for `qr-1634733813616` in `rules/example-rules.json`
