# Styling

## Layout

There is an SCSS folder `src > scss` that contains partials. These control some of the more general styling like fonts, colours, and reused components like buttons.

Styling for each component is contained locally, ie the styling for the carousels is in `src > carousels > SCSS`. It has been built using [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/), but you can write regular CSS if you wish, as it is compatible.
