# Icons

This project comes with fontawesome added by default so you can adjust or add icons at will. It has been installed by being added in `/src/assets/fontawesome/js/all.js` and linked in the head tag of `index.html`

It is then as simple as adding in your HTML the correct fontawesome tags i.e. `<i className="fa-solid fa-shopping-cart"></i>`
