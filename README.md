# React Boilerplate for Custom Demos

Welcome to the parent directory of the Boilerplate. You can find detailed documentation on how to build your own Algolia demo [here](https://boilerplate-docs.netlify.app/)

This parent directory contains two sub-directories: a repo for the Boilerplate code, and a repo containing the documentation site. You only need to enter the `documentation` directory if you wish to edit the documentation; for building an Algolia demo, you'll need the `boilerplate` directory.

If you'd like to start using this boilerplate for a project, please template this repository to get started.
We recommend using yarn, but you can use npm if you wish, but you must run `npm install -force` when in the boilerplate directory in order to install the dependencies correctly.

## What is the Boilerplate?

The Boilerplate is a tool built by the Demo Engineering team of Algolia to help build neat, reliable and fast custom demos that showcase most of the features of Algolia.
The Boilerplate is highly scalable, and customizable. It is made with ReactInstantSearchHooks and it is ready to be configured and deployed quickly.
By following the steps described in this documentation you will be able to build your own Algolia application in matter of minutes.

Happy Coding!
