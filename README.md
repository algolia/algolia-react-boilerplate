<h2 style="font-family='Helvetica'; font-size=15px; font-weight=bold; color=grey;">⭐️ Get started</h2>

1. Clone this repo under a new name for your own demo.

2. Visit `src/config` and adjust `algoliaEnvConfig` to point to your own app, indices and API keys. If you do not need an index which is present in that file i.e. for articles, please do not remove it, just leave it as is, and you can turn off the relevant feature in the next step.

3. Visit `src/config` and adjust `featuresConfig` to activate/deactivate the features you would like to see in the app.

4. Go through the other files in `src/config` and adjust them according to your own data and requirements, each file describes itself.

5. In in `src/config` , pay particular attention to `hitsConfig` as this is where we map your own attribute names to those used in the app. You should never adjust the attributes used in the app itself, only this map.

6. Run and test your app locally both in desktop and mobile view, if you have any questions, ask #help-demos.

7. In the `src/scss` folder, adjust any styling you need to based on what you see.

8. Log into Netlify on the Algolia Demos team (again ask #help-demos if you don't have access) and deploy your demo from Github, making sure to password protect it!

<h2 style="font-family='Helvetica'; font-size=15px; font-weight=bold; color=grey;">⭐️ Structure</h2>

Index.jsx

- entry point to the application
- renders App.js into #root element in DOM
- #root is defined in index.html

App.jsx

- called by Index.jsx
- wraps child components with key functionality including:
  - [React router](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/overview)
  - [Algolia instantsearch](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch)
  - [Recoil state management](https://recoiljs.org/)
- calls Main.jsx

Main.jsx

- contains static elements like header and footer (found in `./components`)
- contains routes for each page (found in `./pages`)
- wraps pages in AnimatePresence from [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/animate-presence/), which helps animate loading of pages
- it loads a single route (page), depending on the current URL

Homepage.jsx

- if federated search is true in configuration, loads federated search
- loads a banners component from `./components`
- maps over carousels from configuration and renders each carousel
- wraps all components in animations from framer-motion

SearchResultsPage.jsx

- called by Main.jsx for route `/search`
- loads components related to results

ProductDetails.jsx

- Display attributes of an individual product
  - Image
  - Brand
  - Name
  - Colour

<h2 style="font-family='Helvetica'; font-size=15px; font-weight=bold; color=grey;">🗳 Features Config</h2>

[Banner](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/rules/merchandising-and-promoting/how-to/add-banners/)

There are two types of banners in this demo - Homepage banners and Search Result Page banners. Check out the existing examples on the flagship fashion index to see some examples. 

How Configure it 👇

- In rules Section in the Dashboard, you have 2 'HomeBanner' rules without query conditions.
- You can edit or duplicate one of these, and personalise the differrent fields:
  - Images (For the background, or for the thumbnails)
  - Link or Text for the buttons
  - Titles and Subtitles
- In the code you have a condition, actually they are called together, but you can keep by type :

  - HomeBannerOne or HomeBannerTwo

- The Search Result Page banners are generally set to queries (eg 'shoes'). It'll contain:
  - type: set this to "bannersrp"
  - title
  - banner: this is an image url
  - link: often a link to a page (eg './categoryPageWoman.html')

<h3 style="font-family='Helvetica'; font-size=15px; font-weight=bold; color=grey;"> 👀 Segments</h3>

You can add segments to the application to represent algolia being told that the current user has certain characteristics. It is not 1:1 personalisation and would be fed in by an external system such as Dynamic Yield.

These "segments" are sent to Algolia as [optional filters](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/rules/merchandising-and-promoting/how-to/how-to-promote-with-optional-filters/), which are used to boost hits that match those filters.

Use this feature by adjusting `config/segmentConfig` and turn on or off this feature in `config/featuresConfig`.

<h3 style="font-family='Helvetica'; font-size=15px; font-weight=bold; color=grey;"> 👀 Badges</h3>

You can dynamically add badges based on any condition for an attribute returned in a hit.

There are two examples already defined in `/config/badgesConfig`, please follow the same example by adjusting that file.

When two triggers are matched, the one found first in the configuration array will be the one which is shown, more than one badge is not currently supported.

<h3 style="font-family='Helvetica'; font-size=15px; font-weight=bold; color=grey;"> 👀 Facet Display</h3>

[Facet Display](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/ui-and-ux-patterns/facet-display/react/)

The ability to control the facets to display and their order works by sending a dedicated.

<h3 style="font-family='Helvetica'; font-size=15px; font-weight=bold; color=grey;"> 👀 Category Pages</h3>

[Category Pages]

In order to configure Category Pages (Add or Remove) go in config > header.js. From there you can add some link in the Navigation tab

<h3 style="font-family='Helvetica'; font-size=15px; font-weight=bold; color=grey;"> 💉 Injected Content</h3>

We use the [Magazine Layout](https://github.com/algolia/magazine-layout)

There are two kinds of injected content:

1. Using rules in the main index
2. Using a seperate index

<h4 style="font-family='Helvetica'; font-size=15px; font-weight=bold; color=grey;">INJECTION FROM MAIN INDEX</h4>

We have two kinds of rules. If you want to trigger these rules for your own demo, please use the given JSON source for the rules which you must add as a consequence (please edit the values as you see fit):
  
1. Free returns (always displayed)
- You can edit the displayed hit by going to `/components/hits/NoCtaCard.js`

- Rule consequence JSON structure:
```
{
  "type": "noCta",
  "title": "",
  "image": {
    "desktop_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/hugo-valla/image/upload/v1641220366/L_ptpbwc.png",
    "mobile_url": "https://api.lorem.space/image/shoes?w-300&h-300"
  },
  "position": 7,
  "isSalesCardDisplay": 6,
  "gridSpanLaptop": 1,
  "gridSpanMobile": 1,
  "size": {
    "width": 3,
    "height": 1
  }
```

2. Sales card ('nike' trigger)
- You can edit the displayed hit by going to `/components/hits/SalesCard.js`

- Rule consequence JSON structure:
```
{
  "type": "salesCard",
  "title": "Receive an extra 20% off nike items",
  "subtitle": "",
  "coupon": "Code: NIKE20",
  "image": {
    "desktop_url": "https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2021/03/lil-nas-x-mschf-nike-satan-shoes-blood-pentagram-bible-verse-design-fashion-footwear_dezeen_2364_col_3-scaled.jpg",
    "mobile_url": "https://"
  },
  "position": 3,
  "size": {
    "width": 1,
    "height": 1
  }
}
```

You can see these rules for reference in the Flagship Fashion [Dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/apps/853MYZ81KY/rules/flagship_fashion).

<h4 style="font-family='Helvetica'; font-size=15px; font-weight=bold; color=grey;">INJECTION FROM SEPERATE INDEX</h4>

- You can edit the displayed hit by going to `/components/hits/InfluencerCard.js`

For this we define a new index in `algoliaEnvConfig.js` called `injectedContentIndex` and if there is a result in this index, we inject it as a result into the Hits.

Here is a sample record structure which is expected for records in the index to inject:
```
{
  "name": "Curry Stephen Under Armour",
  "gender": "Man",
  "influencer": {
    "name": "Stephen Curry",
    "slug": "steph_curry",
    "image": "https://about.underarmour.com/sites/default/files/styles/1600xauto/public/2020-11/SC_Curry%20Brand%20FW20%20%284%29.jpg?itok=Rx555Up8"
  },
  "category": "Shoes",
  "sku": "M0E20000000EL70",
  "objectID": "fab81fae69624_dashboard_generated_id"
}
```

  <h3 style="font-family='Helvetica'; font-size=15px; font-weight=bold; color=grey;"> Icons</h3>

  This project comes with fontawesome added by default so you can adjust or add icons at will. It has been installed by being added in `/src/assets/fontawesome/js/all.js` and linked in the head tag of `index.html`

  You can add your icons by using this method: https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/add-icons/how-to

  <h3 style="font-family='Helvetica'; font-size=15px; font-weight=bold; color=grey;">⏰ Debounce</h3>

[Debounce Lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.debounce)

The Utility of this package is to wait before action, for example on the SearchBox, onChange wait some time before send query.


  <h3 style="font-family='Helvetica'; font-size=15px; font-weight=bold; color=grey;">⏰ Lazy Loading</h3>

  We use the React library Suspense and lazy to load components when needed, and a wrapper called lazily because the default react library doesn't support named exports.

  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-lazily
