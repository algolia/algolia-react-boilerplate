## What is Algolia?

Algolia is a hosted search engine, offering full-text, numerical, and faceted search, capable of delivering real-time results from the first keystroke.

Our search API powers billions of queries for thousands of companies every month, delivering relevant results in under 100ms anywhere in the world.

## What is the Boilerplate?

The Boilerplate (BP) is a tool built by the Demo Engineering team of Algolia to help build neat, reliable and fast custom demos that showcase most of the features of Algolia.
The BP is highly scalable, and customizable. It is made with ReactInstantSearchHooks and it is ready to be configured and deployed quickly.
By following the steps described in this documentation you will be able to build your own Algolia application in matter of minutes.

## Who’s using it?

The boilerplate is used firstly by the demo engineering team itself to create proof of concept that showcase Algolia features.
This application is also used by our solutions engineering team to showcase Algolia’s last feature and create quality POC as fast as possible.
