# No Results Page

To have the best UI, we defined the no results page with 3 parts:

- First, we just display the wrong query, eg: `yellow pant nike` with an apology message.
- Secondly, we incorporate the query suggestions to help the customer on navigation behavior.
- Third, we have stored if the person has already been on our website, and his previous viewed articles. Then if he types a wrong query, we use Recommend and Related Products with his last seen article to create a carousel.
