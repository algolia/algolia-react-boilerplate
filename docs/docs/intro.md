The boilerplate (BP) is a tool built by the demo engineering team of Algolia to help build neat, reliable and fast custom demos that showcase most of the features of Algolia.
The BP is highly scalable, and customizable. It is made with ReactInstantSearchHooks and it is ready to be configured and deployed quickly.
By following the steps described in this documentation you will be able to build your own Algolia’s applications in matter of minutes.
